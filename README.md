TITLE:- SUBJECT MANAGEMENT

⭐ ABSTRACT:-

The Subject Management System is a console-based application developed in the C programming language. The main objective of this project is to store and manage subject details in an organized way. The system allows the user to add subjects with a unique code, subject name and number of credits. It also provides options to display all stored subjects and search for a specific subject using its code. The program uses structures and arrays to store the data in memory, and a menu-driven approach to perform various operations. This project helps in understanding basic data handling, structure usage, and menu-driven programming in C.

⭐ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS :-

Hardware:
* Computer / Laptop
* Minimum 2GB RAM
* Keyboard and Monitor
  
Software:
* Windows / Linux / Mac
* C Programming Language
* GCC Compiler
* VS Code (to write and run the code)
* Libraries Used:
* stdio.h
* string.h
* Others:
*Console / Terminal to run the program

⭐ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:- 

* Add Subject
* Subject Code
* Subject Name
* Credits

The subject should be stored in the array.

Display All Subjects

* The system must display all subjects stored in the list.
* It should show code, name, and credits for each subject.
* If no subjects exist, it must show a message.

Search Subject by Code

* The system must allow the user to enter a subject code to search.

* If found, it must show the subject details.

* If not found, display “Subject Not Found”.

Exit System

* The system must terminate when the user selects exit option.

⭐ FEATURES:-

* Allows users to add subject details.
* Stores subject code, name, and credits.
* Displays all the added subjects in the system.
* Allows searching of a subject using its code.
* Shows a message if the subject is not found.
* Uses structures to store the data.
* Easy menu-based options for the user.
* Runs directly in the terminal.

⭐ HOW TO RUN THE CODE:-

* Open VS Code
* Create a file → subject.c
* Paste your code in it
* Save the file
* Open terminal
* Type:
* gcc subject.c
* Then type:
* ./a.exe
